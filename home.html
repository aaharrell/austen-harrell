                    My name is Austen Harrell. I've lived in Montana since 2010, and I've resided in Bozeman (mostly) since first attending
                    Montana State University in 2016. I graduated in 2020 with a B.S. in mechanical engineering, which ultimately led me to the power
                    delivery industry in early 2021. I currently work for Ulteig Engineering, Inc. as a design engineer while working towards my B.S.
                    in computer science at MSU. I have been in the industry since 2021 and focus primarily on transmission line design and 
                    internal software engineering efforts.

                    In my free time, I try to enjoy the outdoors as much as possible. Montana makes it easy to go fishing, camping, hiking,
                    and dirtbiking. I also enjoy playing learning new programming skills and languages, reading, board games, and video games.

                    I developed this site as a side project to show off my meager web design skills. It is meant to accompany my resume and tell
                    my personal story better than a single side of 8.5"x11" can. This site is hosted by GitHub and was written by me.
