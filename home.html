                    My name is Austen Harrell. I've lived in Montana since 2010, and I've resided in Bozeman (mostly) since first attending
                    Montana State University in 2016. I graduated in 2020 with a B.S. in mechanical engineering, which ultimately led me to the power
                    delivery industry in early 2021. I currently work for Ulteig Engineering, Inc. as a design engineer while working towards my B.S.
                    in computer science back at MSU.

                    In my free time, I try to enjoy the outdoors as much as possible. Montana makes it easy to get away for fishing, camping, hiking,
                    and dirtbiking. I also enjoy playing learning new programming skills and languages, reading, board games, and video games.

                    <div class = "text-separator"></div>
                    I developed this site for two main reasons: the first was to work on my front-end skills - the second was to highlight 
                    my journey and experience better than a single side of 8.5"x11" can. What you see here was made possible by GitHub, who is
                    conveniently hosting both my ever-growing repo collection and my code for this site.
